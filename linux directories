pwd:- This command displays information about the current working directory.
ls:- This command will list all the content of the current working directory.
ls -a:- The first, -a, will list all files which are hidden. Files can be hidden in the Linux file system if the first character in its name is contains a period.
ls -l:- Your output for -l is quite different. This flag allows you to list much more information about the content, such as owner and permissions.
You can execute a combination of the above two flags into one command, which is ls -la
cd:- change the current working directory to a specified directory.
mkdir:- Create a directory, using either the relative or absolute path.
rmdir:- Delete a specified directory given the relative or absolute path.
